# Clear Mountain State University (CMSU) College Data Analysis
The project involves analyzing survey data from students, with various questions aimed at understanding relationships between variables like gender, major, graduation intentions, employment status, and computer usage. We calculate probabilities based on the assumption that the sample is representative of the entire CMSU student population.
* Several tables are required to explore relationships between gender and other variables such as major, graduation intentions, employment, and computer usage.
* Probabilities related to gender distribution among students are calculated, such as the likelihood of selecting a male or female student at random.
* Conditional probabilities are also explored, including the likelihood of different majors among male and female students and the intention to graduate among them.
* Gender-based differences in income
* Summary analysis hints that females in the CMSU sample seem more certain about completing their graduation compared to males. Additionally, there is an observed trend of females having higher income levels.
* This overall analysis involves both descriptive statistics and inferential statistics to understand student demographics and behavior. The analysis designed to provide insights into gender-based differences among students regarding major, employment, and graduation intentions.
